# Introduction to USD<br/>

Universal Scene Description (USD) is a powerful tool for describing and organizing 3D scenes, helping to arrange elements like objects, lights, and cameras in a clear structure with relationships such as parent, child. It is especially beneficial for artists and developers in film, games, and other fields that require high-quality 3D content. Different software tools, like modeling, shading, and rendering programs, often use their own formats for 3D scenes, which donâ€™t work well together, making it challenging to share and edit data across various tools.<br/>

#### Key Features of USD:<br/>
Scene Organization: USD helps you arrange the parts of a 3D scene in a structured way.<br/>
Layered Editing: You can work on different parts of the scene separately, making it easy to change things without affecting the whole scene.<br/>
Easy Sharing: USD makes it simple to share your 3D scene between different software tools.<br/>
Handles Big Scenes: It can manage large and complex scenes without slowing down.<br/>
Customizable: You can change and add new features to fit your specific project needs.<br/>

In summary, USD helps you build, edit, and share 3D scenes more efficiently.<br/>
