# Introduction to USD

Universal Scene Description (USD) is a powerful tool for describing and organizing 3D scenes, helping to arrange elements like objects, lights, and cameras in a clear structure with relationships such as parent, child. It is especially beneficial for artists and developers in film, games, and other fields that require high-quality 3D content. Different software tools, like modeling, shading, and rendering programs, often use their own formats for 3D scenes, which donâ€™t work well together, making it challenging to share and edit data across various tools.

### Key Features of USD:
Scene Organization: USD helps you arrange the parts of a 3D scene in a structured way.
Layered Editing: You can work on different parts of the scene separately, making it easy to change things without affecting the whole scene.
Easy Sharing: USD makes it simple to share your 3D scene between different software tools.
Handles Big Scenes: It can manage large and complex scenes without slowing down.
Customizable: You can change and add new features to fit your specific project needs.

In summary, USD helps you build, edit, and share 3D scenes more efficiently.
